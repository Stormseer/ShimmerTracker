# Aryella's Shimmer Tracker

This simple addon tracks your Shimmer/Blink CD and puts a text on your screen when you can't cast Shimmer/Blink.   
It has the cooldown values of Shimmer/Blink *HARD CODED*. If you're a monkey and don't take all the cooldown nodes, I'm not going to help you :)

Your cancelaura macro HAS TO look like this: 
> #showtooltip Alter Time  
> /cancelaura Alter Time  
> /run AlterTimeCancelled()   
The macro is case sensitive!
