# Aryella's Shimmer Tracker

This simple addon tracks your Shimmer/Blink CD and puts a text on your screen when you can't cast Shimmer/Blink. 
It has the cooldown values of Shimmer/Blink *HARD CODED*. If you're a monkey and don't take all the cooldown nodes, I'm not going to help you :)

If you want to use a different way to signal to the addon that you've cancelled Alter Time, go check the options panel and put in the spell ID.
