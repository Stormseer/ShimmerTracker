# Aryella's (Glowing) Interrupt Icon

This is a tiny WoW Addon that is supposed to help with tracking your kick cooldown. It creates an icon for your kick that you can move around and resize as you please. 
The icon will only show if you have a focus target, and will glow if your focus target is casting. 

Sadly in Midnight you can't check if what your focus target is casting is interruptable or not, so it will glow on uninterruptible casts as well.

Usage: 
| Command     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| /iitest      | Acts as if you just kicked, for testing purposes (puts it on 20 second cooldown).       |
| /iisize X   | Changes the size of the icon.         |
| /iilock    | Locks/Unlocks the icon.         |
