# Aryella's Shimmer Tracker

This simple addon tracks your Shimmer/Blink CD and puts a text on your screen when you can't cast Shimmer/Blink. 
It has the cooldown values of Shimmer/Blink *HARD CODED*. If you're a monkey and don't take all the cooldown nodes, I'm not going to help you :)

If you want to use a different way to signal to the addon that you've cancelled Alter Time, go check the options panel and put in the spell ID. 

Your cancelaura macro has to look something like this: 
> #showtooltip Alter Time
> /cancelaura Alter Time
> /cast Pygmy Oil
